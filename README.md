# **Case study project**

### **About:**

This is a case study project, which is a top-down shooting survival game. Because this project is meant to showcase the game's gameplay mechanics, the UI of the menu scene and other setting features have not been developed fully. The UI/UX is minimal and enough to showcase the main purpose. Please keep it in mind when experiencing the project

## **Gameplay mechanic:**

The player is spawned in the maze and has to reach the end of the maze to complete the level.

During exploration, there are encounters are zombies which not hesitate to attack you if you are in their field of view or make a loud noise around them.

They chase you if you are on target by using navmesh, you have to defeat them or run out of their field of view.

## **Gun system:**

There are two types of guns, rifles and shotguns, and you can switch the gun in your favor by pressing the switch gun button.

The rifle fires bullets rapidly, and the shotgun bursts at the target in range.

Each gun has its own total magazine and bullets. Auto reloads a new magazine if the bullets of the current magazine are out of stock, or you can reload manually by pressing the reload button.
